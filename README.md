# WebBrowser.py
A web browser made with python

This is a silly project. That I do not think details that how I shader the DOM and CSSOM item. So I will put this project until I had a good solution can deal with the shader. BTW, do not trust the big company core.

## Is it possible to not use the chromium to build a browser?
